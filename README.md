<!-- ## Installation and Usage -->

## Running the Application Locally

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Firebase**: You'll need to create an account on [Firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and set up a new project and obtain your Firebase configuration credentials for storage.
- **Google OAuth Credentials**: To enable Google authentication, you should create a project in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com), enable the Google OAuth API, and obtain your client ID and client secret. These credentials should be added to your `.env.local` file for proper configuration.
